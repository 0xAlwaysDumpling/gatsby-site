Nudge was a goal setting platform that [Will](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wmkelly/), [Mike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtzhai/), and I started at the 2018 MIT Bitcoin Hackathon. Nudge's first use case was using smart contracts to faciliate following scenario:  
````
Alice and Bob want to lose weight. 
They each run 10 miles a week. 
They both decide to stake $200 USD each week where the winner takes all. If there is a tie then they both receive their money back. 
They decide to employ their friend Charlie to referee or moderate each week. And they agree to give him a % of the staked amount for refereeing. 
````
We felt that loss aversion and accountability were essential to accomplishing goals. And developing this concept further we presented the idea of creating a market where users can bet on themselves or allow others to bet against them. \
As a result a self regulated community with infinite possibilities is created. 
# Where is it now? 
I loved this concept but my teammates didn't. This idea ended up just being put into backlog and hasn't been touched since (I am taking a break from working on crypto projects solo).
