Parking in Brooklyn can be cumbersome because there are no parking lots and a ton of driveways for residents. I was in Bay Ridge the other week and faced this issue. However what I noticed was that a lot of these driveways are actually empty. What if we allowed residents to rent out their driveways for parking to others. A system would be needed in place to show lots that are available and the time permitted to park there. And a third party can be used to tow or move cars as necessary.
